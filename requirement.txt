RQ1: How do different imbalance handling techniques (under sampling, SMOTE oversampling, and class weighting) affect the performance of machine learning models in detecting fraudulent transactions?

RQ2: Which machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Isolation Forest) demonstrate superior performance for fraud detection in highly imbalanced transactional datasets?

RQ3: How can an end-to-end fraud detection pipeline be designed to systematically address data preprocessing, imbalance handling, model training, and evaluation in a reproducible and scalable manner?

RQ4: Which evaluation metrics most effectively capture fraud detection performance in highly imbalanced scenarios, and how do they provide different insights compared to traditional accuracy measures?

RQ5: What preprocessing and feature engineering strategies most significantly improve fraud detection performance across different algorithms and datasets?
